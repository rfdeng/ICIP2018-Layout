\section{CONCLUSION}
\label{sec:Con}

In this paper, we propose to utilize the geometric hint from an RGB image for room layout estimation. We estimate the depth and normals from the input image and then fuse them to train an MC-FCN. We demonstrate how the geometric hint improves the performance of surface segmentation. Then we incorporate a proposing-ranking policy to generally optimize the room layout. Owing to these techniques, our method is robust to complex environmental factors in indoor scenes.
