\section{CONCLUSION}
\label{sec:Con}

In this paper, we propose to fully utilize the geometric information from an RGB image for room layout estimation. We estimate the depth and normal maps from the original image and then combine them together to train a multi-channel FCN. We demonstrate how these geometric hints can help to improve the performance of semantic surface segmentation. Then we incorporate a proposing-ranking policy to generally optimize the room layout. Quantitative experiments have been conducted on two benchmark datasets.
