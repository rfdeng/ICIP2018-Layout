\section{CONCLUSION}
\label{sec:Con}

In this paper, we propose to utilize geometric hints with an RGB image for room layout estimation. We estimate the depths and normals from the input RGB　image, and fuse them in a multi-channel FCN. 
We demonstrate how the geometric hint improves the performance of surface segmentation. 
Then, we incorporate a proposing-ranking strategy to optimize the estimated room layout. 
Our method is robust to complex environmental factors for indoor scenes.
